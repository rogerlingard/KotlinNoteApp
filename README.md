# Overview

The Software that I wrote is a simple note program that basically allows you to make a note, delete notes, and save them. It helped with learning about the different aspects of Kotlin, like data classes, the when condition, and null safety.

The purpose of writing this software was to learn Kotlin generally, but also the more technical aspects of programming, like tests. I also wanted to learn more about JSON and its uses because I did not know much about it beforehand. So I thought a note project would be good for that, as I could make a simple note program that I could test, and also learn how JSON works a little better through it as well.
